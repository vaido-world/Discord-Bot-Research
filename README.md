## 1. Discord Account Creation
A new user creation is almost always helpful for testing a Discord server.

### reCAPTCHA Challenge for the new Discord users
Discord is known to trigger sometimes seemingly insuperable recaptcha for new users.  
To avoid unecessary hard reCAPTCHA it is best to have an invite to a Discord server.  
Visit [Disboard.org](https://disboard.org) and search for a server to join, to avoid such problem.
